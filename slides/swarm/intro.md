## A brief introduction

- This was initially written by [JÃ©rÃ´me Petazzoni](https://twitter.com/jpetazzo) to support in-person,
  instructor-led workshops and tutorials

- Over time, [multiple contributors](https://@@GITREPO@@/graphs/contributors) also helped to improve these materials â€” thank you!

- You can also follow along on your own, at your own pace

- We included as much information as possible in these slides

- It's recommended having a mentor to help you ...

- ... Or be comfortable spending some time reading the Docker
 [documentation](https://docs.docker.com/) ...

- ... And looking for answers in the [Docker forums](forums.docker.com),
  [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/docker),
  and other outlets

class: self-paced

## Hands on, you shall practice

- Nobody ever became a Jedi by spending their lives reading Wookiepedia

- Likewise, it will take more than merely *reading* these slides
  to make you an expert

- These slides include *tons* of exercises and examples

- They assume that you have access to some Docker nodes

- If you are attending a workshop or tutorial:
  <br/>you will be given specific instructions to access your cluster

- If you are doing this on your own:
  <br/>the first chapter will give you various options to get your own cluster
