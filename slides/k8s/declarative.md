## Declarative vs imperative in Kubernetes

- With Kubernetes, we cannot say: "run this container"

- All we can do is write a *spec* and push it to the API server

  (by creating a resource like e.g. a Pod or a Deployment)

- The API server will validate that spec (and reject it if it's invalid)

- Then it will store it in etcd

- A *controller* will "notice" that spec and act upon it
